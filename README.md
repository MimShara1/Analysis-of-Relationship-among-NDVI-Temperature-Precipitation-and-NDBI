# Analysis-of-Relationship-among-NDVI-Temperature-Precipitation-and-NDBI
Dhaka is a growing megacity in Asia. This project entailes the relationship among vegetation trend, NDBI, temperature and precipitation in Dhakacity for 5years time range. It shows that NDVI has a positive correlation  with precipitation and has inverse correlation with temperature and built-up density. 

The objectives of this project are:
I) To calculate the different vegetation trends NDVI, EVI and SAVI
II)To Calculate Built-up Density ratio NDBI
III)To analyse temperature and precipitation trend for a particular time range
IV) To analyse relationship among Vegetation trends,Temperature, Precipitatiopn and NDBI.
